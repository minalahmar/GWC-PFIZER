    <em>Pakistan</em> is home to the 6th largest population in the world, while also containing the second largest population of Muslims. It is located in South Asia, with Afghanistan and India bordering it.
    It is a relatively new nation, only existing for 72 years. My parents both originate from this nation.
    The land is divided up into 4 regions, with Urdu being its national language. To learn more fun facts about my home country, press the next few words <a href=https://thefactfile.org/pakistan-facts/>to get educated.</a>
